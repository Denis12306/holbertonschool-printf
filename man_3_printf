        Common conversion specifiers include:
       - d, i : signed decimal integer
       - u : unsigned decimal integer
       - o : unsigned octal
       - x, X : unsigned hexadecimal (lowercase/uppercase)
       - f, F : floating-point decimal notation
       - e, E : floating-point in scientific notation
       - g, G : use shortest representation of f or e
       - c : character
       - s : string
       - p : pointer address
       - n : store number of characters written so far

BUGS
        Code such as printf(foo); often indicates a bug, since foo may
       contain a % character.  If foo comes from untrusted user input, it
       may contain %n, causing the printf() call to write to memory and
       creating a security hole.
EXAMPLES
        #include <stdio.h>


int main(void)
{
    printf("Welcome to Holbertonsschool\n");
    return 0;
